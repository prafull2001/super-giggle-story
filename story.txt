Once upon a time there lived a boy named Santiago. Santiago was an ordinary boy, except for the fact that he had a hidden power: his super giggle. Everytime he giggled, the soundwaves created by the sound of him laughing would be so powerful that it could level buildings. As soon as Santiago discovered that he had this power he swore never to use it. One day, however, while Santiago was buying food at his local market, he saw a man pull out and point a gun at the cashier, telling him to empty the register.

This is Teddy and I have accessed your file! Teddy is a trained computer hacker for the CIA and his work is top secret. He has the highest level of security clearance.

As Teddy typed, more and more of Santiago's story was written. So much so, in fact, that the fourth wall was broken and Santiago realized he was a meaningless character in a story that didn't actually matter.
